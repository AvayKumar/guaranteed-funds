            <b><p>After signing up with Guaranteed Funds community, you will donate the sum of either ₦10,000, ₦30,000, ₦100,000, ₦200,000 or ₦500,000 to a fellow participant assigned by an automated system. After this member confirms receipt of your donation, the system will automatically assign two other participants to pay you the amount invested, thus giving you 100% of your investment (i.e. 100% of ₦10,000 is ₦20,000; 100% of ₦30,000 is ₦60,000, etc). Return of investment is within 48 hours to 14 working days after confirmation of receipt of donation. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Referral bonus is paired to get help every 14days. The more you refer, the higher your referral bonus.

            <p>  
              All donations are made directly to participants. Guaranteed Funds is not liable for any losses made and will not collect any payment from participants as we do not run a central account. This is a community of mutual financial help.
            </p>
            
            <p>  
              Guaranteed Funds thrives with the influx of new members in the community. So we encourage members to use their referral links to earn more money and also invite friends and family to the Guaranteed Funds community so they can also gain financial freedom.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Members get help between 48hours and 14 working days. This time frame is dependent on the influx of new members into the community.
